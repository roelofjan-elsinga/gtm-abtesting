# Scheduling

There is the possibility to schedule experiments. This can be done by setting up a custom firing scheduling for **all** the experimentation tags.

Enable the custom tag firing schedule on the following tags:

- Experiment 1 – Control – Script
- Experiment 1 – Variant A – Script
- Experiment 1 – Splitter

---

1. Open the **tag**.
2. Open **Advanced Settings**.
3. **Enable custom tag firing schedule**.
4. Select the **start and end date** (including times).
5. **Repeat these steps** for all related tags to the scheduled experiment.
