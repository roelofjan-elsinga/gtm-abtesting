This all started when Google Optimize was about to go away. At that time, there weren't any good free or cheap options available.

As I, [Sander Volbeda](https://sandervolbeda.com){:target="_blank"}, looked for different ways to do A/B tests, I found out you can actually use Google Tag Manager. It might not have been the first thing that came to mind. But the best part is, it's free and it's probably already there on the website you're trying to make better.

If you require expert assistance in setting this up, you can explore the services I offer on my [website](https://sandervolbeda.com){:target="_blank"}. Feel welcome to get in touch with me through my website whenever you'd like, or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/sandervolbeda){:target="_blank"}.
