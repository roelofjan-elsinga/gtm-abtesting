It\u2019s worth noting that this process is asynchronous, which means that it occurs during the website loading phase rather than after it has loaded.</p> <p>When a visitor lands on your website, Google Tag Manager will trigger the initialisation event, which is the first thing we\u2019ll set up. This event will trigger the initialisation trigger.</p> <p>When the initialisation trigger is fired, the splitter tag will run. The splitter tag will execute JavaScript code that splits our traffic and saves the version of the experiment in the visitor\u2019s localStorage.</p> <p>The GA4 configuration tag will be triggered by the page view trigger, which will send our data to GA4 with a version variable.</p> <p>The container-loaded event can also trigger two tags, depending on the stored version.</p> <p>If the version includes slots 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, the variant trigger will be fired, which will execute the variant tag that contains the experiment code.</p> <p>If the version includes slots 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, the control trigger will be fired, which will execute the control tag.</p> <p>Each slot represents 10% of the traffic, and the number of slots is used to randomly split the traffic and facilitate Multi-Variant Testing.</p>"},{"location":"setup/","title":"Setup","text":"<p>Let\u2019s start with creating a custom definition in Google Analytics 4.
